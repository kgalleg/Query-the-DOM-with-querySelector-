// this is practicing the lighting exercises on book 2 chapter 2 on Objects. on Friday May 31, 2019

// Lightning Exercise 1: Given two options of data structures - array or object - which should you use? You need to represent a red 2015 Ford Mustang in your code.

// Lightning Exercise 2: Given two options of data structures - array or object - which should you use? You need to store list of animal names in a shelter. The names are "Kippers", "Jack", "Gypsy", "Angus", "Seymour Bouts", and "Sharky".

// Lightning Exercise 3: Define an object for four family members, and put each object in an array named familyMembers. Each family member object that you create should have the same keys on them, but the values will be different.

let myCar = {
color: "red",
year: "2015",
type: "Ford Mustang"
}
console.log(myCar)

`I love my ${car.color} ${car.model}`

const animalsInShelter = ["Kippers", "Jack", "Gypsy", "Angus", "Seymour Bouts", "Sharky"]

const mom = {
    first_name: "Josie",
    age: "59",
    likesDogs: true
}

const sisterOne = {
    first_name: "Alex",
    age: "39",
    likesDogs: true
}

const brother = {
    first_name: "Ernie",
    age: "27",
    likesDogs: true
}

const sisterTwo = {
    first_name: "Monica",
    age: "23",
    likesDogs: true
}

const familyMembers = [mom, sisterOne, brother, sisterTwo]

// could also do an array of objects 

// If they were all inside and array you could access them like this:
// familyMembers[1].age
